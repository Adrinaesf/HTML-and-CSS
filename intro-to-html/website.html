<!-- 
In this file we have instructions for:
* HTML elements

1. button
2. paragraphs 
3. HTML tag: it tells what element we are making
it has two parts: opening tag, and closing tag
4. Link to another websites
5. HTML attribute: Modifies how an elemnt behaves like: 
href -> A link to another page
target -> Determines if we want to open it in another page
Syntax rule: need a space + attribute name + = + "val"

6. weird stuff with HTML: 
HTML ignores extera spaces + new lines

<!-- 
  Nesting: We can have elements in the elements 
  We only have one element of html, one body and head inside it
  and every code we write goes inside that
  
  body element: conatin all elements that we see

  head element: keeps all the elements that we can't see
  Ex: title changes the text in the tab
  -->

<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html>
  <head> 
    <title> First Website </title>
  </head>
  
  <body> 
    <button>
