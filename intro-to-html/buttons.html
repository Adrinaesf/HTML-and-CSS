<!-- 
  In this file, we try to make buttons, and style them
  using CSS. 
  In style tag, we can write CSS codes :D
  We learn DevTools



  General technique: 
    1. Create element with HTML
    2. Style with CSS one-by-one

  CSS Syntax Rule: 
  * Buttons Style: 
    CSS Selector (button):
      it tells what we are changing. 
      the text inside is the property that we can change:
      like we change the property of background color to red
      you end the properties in style with ;
* Features: 
   background color -> rgb: another way to choose a color (red, green, blue)
   text color
   border
   height -> in pixcels
   width
   corners
   space -> margin

   * HTML attribute: 
   - class: Lets us label the html element
---------------------------------------
  * Hovers, Transitions, Shadows:
    Hover: when your cursor goes on it and it changes its style
      Know as pseudo-class -> changes style in certain situations
        Ex: :hover, :active -> when you click the button

  * Features: 
    Opacity: a number between 0 to 1 that fades the element
    as you decrese it more, it fades out more

    transition: makes it smooth, takes 2 values. 

    box-shadow: takes 4 values. right down blur color
---------------------------------------
Padding: 
* Adds spaces to the inside of buttons
  padding-lift, padding-right, padding-top
* CSS Box Models
  Gives you info about the box: like margin, border, padding, and more
* vertical align: aligns everything based on what you say:
default -> the texts
