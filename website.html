In this file we have instructions for:
* HTML elements

1. button
2. paragraphs 
3. HTML tag: it tells what element we are making
it has two parts: opening tag, and closing tag
4. Link to another websites
5. HTML attribute: Modifies how an elemnt behaves like: 
href -> A link to another page
target -> Determines if we want to open it in another page
Syntax rule: need a space + attribute name + = + "val"

6. weird stuff with HTML: 
HTML ignores extera spaces + new lines
